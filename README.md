  __| | A Cesium Point Cloud tile generator written in golang
 |___/ 
```


**gocesiumtiler** is a tool to convert point cloud stored as LAS files to Cesium.js 3D tiles ready to be
streamed, automatically generating the appropriate level of details and including additional information for each point 
such as color, laser intensity and classification.   

## What's new: V2
gocesiumtiler V2 has been released in preview mode and it introduces several important improvements over V1. Please refer to the changelog for a full list of changes.

This release is backward incompatible compared to V1 and also deprecates several options, most of which were not of much interest.
Some of these might be added in future minor updates of V2.
- Refine mode "REPLACE" is currently unavailable in V2
- Recursive options is currently unavailable in V2
- Algorithm cannot be chosen anymore: grid sampling is the only one available and is implicitly used

Note that V2.0.0-gamma+ releases are incompatible with V2 beta. This is to be expected as these are pre-release versions.
The major change between the two regards the support for the latest Proj library versions.

## Features
gocesiumtiler V2 offers the following features:

- Supports LAS 1.4 and writes Intensity and Classification attributes into the final point cloud
- Performs automatic coordinate conversion without any external library dependency
- Allows setting a custom elevation offset for the point clouds points
- Can automatically subsample the input point clouds
- Can merge multiple LAS files into a single tileset automatically
- Supports both 3D Tiles Specs 1.0 (.pnts) and (experimentally) 3D Tiles v1.1 (glTF/GLB assets)
- Fast: Uses all available cores and minimizes disk operations
- High quality sampling via an uniform sampling scheme
- Can read LAS with colors encoded in 8bit color space rather than 16bit
- Can be used in other golang programs as a library with a simple to use interface
- Supports the programmatic definition of custom mutators to manipulate points and attributes
- Uses the Proj library and can receive as input any EPSG code, Proj4 or WKT projection definition supported by Proj 9.5.0+
  (for some the relevant Proj grid files should be installed)
- Uses a "ADD" refine method, which minimizes redundant data across tiles


**New from v2.0.0-gamma**: Convertion between EGM and WGS84 elevations is now delegated to Proj. Just make sure to specify the correct input vertical datum and make sure the `share` folder contains the required vertical grids. These are not included but can be downloaded from the [Proj CDN](https://cdn.proj.org/)

The currently tool uses the version 9.5.0 of the well-known Proj.4 library to handle coordinate conversion. The input CRS
specified by just providing the relative EPSG code, a Proj4 string or WKT text.

Speed is a major concern for this tool, thus it has been chosen to store the data completely in memory. If you don't 
have enough memory the tool will fail, so if you have really big LAS files and not enough RAM it is advised to split 
the LAS in smaller chunks to be processed separately.

Information on point intensity and classification is stored in the output tileset Batch Table under the 
propeties named `INTENSITY` and `CLASSIFICATION`.

## Changelog
##### Version 2.0.0
* Most of the code has been rewritten from the ground up, achieving much faster tiling with lower memory usage
* Uses Proj v9.5.0: all projections supported by the Proj library are automatically supported by gocesiumtiler.
* Experimentally supports 3D Tiles v1.1 (GLTF) in addition to v1.0 (PNTS)
* Allows merging multiple LAS files into a single 3D tile
* New options to fine tune the sampling quality: min points per tile, resolution and max tree depth
* Ready to be used as part of other go packages with an easy to use interface
* Vends the mutator interface, to programmatically alter points and point attributes as they are read
* Can automatically subsample input point clouds using a simple random sampling scheme
* Points are now expressed relative to a local cartesian reference system with Z-up. This results in tighter tile bounds, and
  now shaders can utilize the local Z coordinate for elevation-based shading, which was not possible before.
* Much higher unit test coverage
* The tiler library can be used into external golang projects
* The CLI has been rewritten from scratch, many options changed name or were added/removed
* `GOCESIUMTILER_WORKDIR` has been deprecated

## Precompiled Binaries
Along with the source code a prebuilt binary for Windows x64 and Linux x64 is provided for each release of the tool in the github page.
Binaries for other systems at the moment are not provided.

## Environment setup and compiling from sources
Please note that since release v2.0.0 gamma the development setup has changed considerably and now leverages Docker for reproducible builds. 
Please refer to the [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md) file for further info on how to setup a local development environment in both Windows and Linux.

In general local development requires:

- Downloading the Proj sources
- Building Proj as a static library
- Building gocesiumtiler linking it statically to Proj and its dependencies

See [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md)

## Installation instructions

1. Download the latest version of the executable from the Releases section in github and unzip it
1. Make sure the executable is in the same folder where the `share` folder is. 
2. (Optional) If you need special grids to convert your data (e.g. in case of EGM to WGS84 elevation conversion or some less common projections), please download the Proj Data grids from the [Proj CDN](https://cdn.proj.org/) and unpack them in the `share` folder. 
3. Execute the binary tool with the appropriate flags.

## CLI Usage

To run just execute the binary tool with the appropriate flags.

To show the help run:
```
gocesiumtiler -help
```

### Commands
There are two commands, `file` and `folder`:

* `gocesiumtiler file { flags } myfile.las`: Converts `myfile.las` into a Cesium 3D point cloud using the flags passed in input (see below).
* `gocesiumtiler folder { flags } myfolder`: Finds all LAS files into `myfolder` and convers them into one or more Cesium 3D Point clouds using the flags passed as input (see below).S

### Flags

#### Common flags
These flags are applicable to both the `file` and the `folder` commands
```
   --out value, -o value                  full path of the output folder where to save the resulting Cesium tilesets
   --crs value, --epsg value, -e value    String representing the input CRS. It could be e.g. "EPSG:32633", just "32633", or a full Proj4 or WKT string.
   --resolution value, -r value           minimum resolution of the 3d tiles, in meters. approximately represets the maximum sampling distance between any two points at the lowest level of detail (default: 20)
   --z-offset value, -z value             z offset to apply to the point, in meters. only use it if the input elevation is referred to the WGS84 ellipsoid or geoid (default: 0)
   --depth value, -d value                maximum depth of the output tree. (default: 10)
   --min-points-per-tile value, -m value  minimum number of points to enforce in each 3D tile (default: 5000)
   --8-bit                                set to interpret the input points color as part of a 8bit color space (default: false)  
   --subsample value                      Approximate percent of points to keep in the final point cloud, between 0.01 (1%) and 1 (100%) (default: 1)
   --help, -h                             show help
```

#### Folder command flags
These commands are specific to the `folder` command:
```
   --join, -j                             merge the input LAS files in the folder into a single cloud. The LAS files must have the same properties (CRS etc) (default: false)
```

#### A note on vertical coordinate conversion
Previous releases of gocesiumtiler had a dedicated flag for EGM to WGS84 ellipsoid elevation conversion. This has been deprecated and now the vertical datum conversion is fully delegated to Proj.
This means that to convert the vertical coordinates in case they are not referred to the WGS84 ellipsoid the input CRS definition needs to include the definition for the vertical datum.

This can be achieved for example by providing a composite CRS EPSG code. 

For example, if a LAS file contains coordinates in the `EPSG:32633` CRS with elevations referred to the EGM2008 (`EPSG:3855`), run the command with:
```
--crs EPSG:32633+3855
```
**NOTE:** This might require to install extra grid files in the `share` folder. In case of issues please make sure please to download the Proj Data grids from the [Proj CDN](https://cdn.proj.org/) and save them in the `share` folder.

### Usage examples:

#### Example 1
Convert all LAS files in folder `C:\las`, write output tilesets in folder `C:\out`, assume LAS input coordinates expressed 
in EPSG:32633, with elevations referred to the EGM2008 (EPSG 3855). Use a resolution of 10 meters, create tiles with minimum 1000 points
and enforce a maximum tree depth of 12:

```
gocesiumtiler folder -out C:\out -crs EPSG:32633+3855 -resolution 10 -min-points-per-tile 1000 -depth 12 C:\las
```

or, using the shorthand notation:
```
gocesiumtiler folder -o C:\out -e EPSG:32633+3855 -r 10 -m 1000 -d 12 C:\las
```

#### Example 2
Like Example 1 but merge all LAS files in `C:\las` into a single 3D Tileset

```
gocesiumtiler folder -out C:\out -crs EPSG:32633+3855 -resolution 10 -min-points-per-tile 1000 -depth 12 -join C:\las
```

or, using the shorthand notation:
```
gocesiumtiler folder -o C:\out -e EPSG:32633+3855 -r 10 -m 1000 -d 12 -j C:\las
```

#### Example 3
Convert a single LAS file at `C:\las\file.las`, write the output tileset in the folder `C:\out`, use the system defaults

```
gocesiumtiler file -out C:\out -crs 32633 C:\las\file.las
```
or, using the shorthand notation:

```
gocesiumtiler file -o C:\out -e 32633 C:\las\file.las
```

## Library Usage in other GO programs

To use the tiler in other go programs just:

```
go get github.com/mfbonfigli/gocesiumtiler/v2
```

Then instantiate a tiler object and launch it either via `ProcessFiles` or `ProcessFolder` passing in the desired processing options.

A mnimal example is:

```
package main

import (
	"context"
	"log"

	"github.com/mfbonfigli/gocesiumtiler/v2/tiler"
)

func main() {
	t, err := tiler.NewGoCesiumTiler()
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	ctx := context.TODO()
	err = t.ProcessFiles([]string{"myinput.las"}, "/tmp/myoutput", "EPSG:32632", tiler.NewTilerOptions(
		tiler.WithEightBitColors(true),
		tiler.WithWorkerNumber(2),
		tiler.WithMaxDepth(5),
	), ctx)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
}
```

Note that you will require to use `cgo` for the compilation, for how to setup the build environment please refer to the [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md). 

### Mutators

gocesiumtiler from version 2.0.0 final offers the concept of **mutators**. Mutators are implementations of the `mutator.Mutator` interface 
and can be used to manipulate or discard input points. 

The library vends a `ZOffset` mutator to perform vertical traslation of point clouds and a `Subsampler` mutator to thin down the points in the output. 

Other possible uses of mutators (not yet built in into the library) could be, for example:
- Perform color corrections of points
- Colorize the points based on their Classification
- Cut point clouds discarding points outside of given bounds
- etc

To use the mutators just pass them to the tiler options:

```
mut := []mutator.Mutator{
   mutator.NewZOffset(10),
   mutator.NewSubsampler(0.5),
}

err = t.ProcessFiles([]string{"myinput.las"}, "/tmp/myoutput", "EPSG:32632", tiler.NewTilerOptions(
   tiler.WithEightBitColors(true),
   tiler.WithWorkerNumber(2),
   tiler.WithMaxDepth(5),
   tiler.WithMutators(mut),
), ctx)
```

To implement a custom mutator, implement the mutator interface:

```
Mutate(p model.Point, t model.Transform) (model.Point, bool)
```

The Mutate function receives as input the original point and a Transform object that can be used to trasform from the local CRS to the global EPSG 4978 CRS and back. 
The output of the Mutate function is the, eventually manipulated, point and a boolean which should be true if the point should appear in the final point cloud, false otherwise.

**Note: mutators must be goroutine safe.**

#### Example of a custom mutator: coloring points by class

```
type ClassBasedColorMutator struct {}

func (m *ClassBasedColorMutator) Mutate(pt model.Point, localToGlobal model.Transform) (model.Point, bool) {
	switch pt.Classification {
	case 2:
		// ground > brown
		pt.R, pt.G, pt.B = 128, 0, 0
	case 3:
		// low vegetation > dark green
		pt.R, pt.G, pt.B = 0, 60, 0
	case 4:
		// medium vegetation > green
		pt.R, pt.G, pt.B = 0, 130, 0
	case 5:
		// high vegetation > light green
		pt.R, pt.G, pt.B = 30, 170, 30
	case 6:
		// building > orange
		pt.R, pt.G, pt.B = 200, 100, 0
	case 9:
		// water > blue
		pt.R, pt.G, pt.B = 5, 170, 200
	default:
		// all other classes > grey
		pt.R, pt.G, pt.B = 30, 30, 30
	}
	return pt, true
}
```

## Algorithms

The sampling occurs using a hybrid, lazy octree data structure. The algorithm works as follows:
1. All points are stored in a linked tree backed by an underlying array: this provides efficient list manipulations operations (splitting, adding, removing) and avoids
 dynamic allocations of slices. The coordinates are internally converted to EPSG 4978. The backing array helps with CPU cache friendliness and helps achieving measurable speed improvements of up to 20% compared to a standard linked list.
2. An octree cell is created. Every cell stores N points (variable). A cell also has a grid spacing property. The root node has a spacing set to the
 provided resolution. 
3. The points are traversed. Each point will fall into one of the cells the space has been divided by the given grid spacing. If the point is 
 the closest one the the center of the cell, it's taken as new closest for that cell, else it's discarded and parked into a list of the Node octant it belongs to.
4. When all points are traversed the points closes to the cells the space has been partitioned in will be the points for the current tree node. All others are parked.
If an octant however has a number of parked points that is less than the min-points-per-node, the parked points for that octant are rolled up to the current node. Similarly 
if the current node has a depth equal to the configured max depth.
5. Whenever the children are retrieved, the previously parked points are used to create child nodes on demand using the same algorithm, lazily.

## Precompiled Binaries
Along with the source code, a prebuilt binary for both Linux and Windows x64 is provided for each release of the tool in the github page.

## Future work and support

Further work needs to be done, such as: 
- Statically build and link Proj9.5.0 with CURL support enabled
- Add support for point cloud compression
- Extract CRS metadata automatically from LAS VLRs
- Add support for LAZ (compressed LAS) files

Contributors and their ideas are welcome.
